Summary: Canonicalized ProjectState to aicmo.domain.state_machine.ProjectState

Files changed:
- aicmo/domain/project.py: removed local ProjectState definition; import canonical ProjectState and adjusted defaults/mappings.
- aicmo/tools/verify_phase.py: added duplicate ProjectState detection to fail verification if stray definitions exist.
- tests/test_no_duplicate_projectstate.py: added tests to ensure canonical ProjectState contains QC_APPROVED and project module exposes the canonical enum only.

Verification steps performed:
- py_compile of modified files: pycompile.txt
- pytest for new and state-machine tests: pytest.txt
- ran verifier: verify_phase_2.txt

Notes:
- All tests passed and verifier reports Phase 2 PASS.
