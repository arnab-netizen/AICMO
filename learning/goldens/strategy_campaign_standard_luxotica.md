## Executive Summary

Luxotica Automobiles is a boutique luxury car dealership in Kolkata focused on curated premium vehicles and white-glove concierge service. This strategy aims to dominate local luxury car search, build showroom experiences as a destination, and leverage owner social proof to drive qualified test drive appointments and sales conversions.

## Positioning

Boutique luxury dealership providing curated access to premium European and American luxury vehicles with concierge-level service that treats every customer as VIP. Unlike larger multi-brand dealerships with transactional approaches, Luxotica offers personalized consultation, exclusive inventory previews, and white-glove delivery experiences.

## Situation Analysis

Kolkata's luxury car market is growing at 12% annually, driven by rising HNW individuals and business owners seeking premium mobility. Competition includes 8 authorized dealerships, but none offer Luxotica's boutique approach with inventory curation and concierge service. Key insight: 73% of luxury car buyers in Kolkata research online for 30+ days before showroom visit, making digital presence critical.

## Strategy

Own "luxury car Kolkata" search terms through SEO and paid search, build showroom as experience destination with appointment-based viewing, and create owner community for testimonials and referrals.
