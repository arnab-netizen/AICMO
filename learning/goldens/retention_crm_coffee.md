# Peak Coffee Co. – Retention & CRM Strategy

## Brand & Objectives

**Brand:** Peak Coffee Co.  
**Industry:** Subscription Coffee (DTC)  
**Primary Goal:** Increase 12-month customer retention from 45% to 65% and reduce churn by 30%

## Business Context

Specialty coffee subscription service facing high churn after initial 3-month honeymoon period. Strong acquisition but weak retention economics. Need to improve lifetime value and build long-term subscriber loyalty.

## Retention Challenge

Current State: 55% of subscribers cancel within 12 months. Primary churn reasons: "too much coffee," "want to try other brands," "forgot about subscription."

## Retention Strategy

Build emotional connection through coffee education, flexible subscription options, and personalized experiences. Shift from transactional to relationship-driven retention.

## CRM Program Architecture

**Segment 1:** New subscribers (0-90 days) – Onboarding, education, preference discovery  
**Segment 2:** Active loyalists (90+ days, regular engagement) – Appreciation, exclusives, community  
**Segment 3:** At-risk (low engagement, skipped deliveries) – Re-engagement, flexibility, win-back  
**Segment 4:** Power users (high spend, referrals) – VIP perks, early access, recognition

## Retention Tactics

- Flexible delivery frequency controls
- Swap/skip capabilities without friction
- Personalized roast recommendations
- Coffee origin stories and brewing guides
- Exclusive limited-edition roasts for loyal subscribers
- Subscriber-only virtual tastings

## Churn Prevention

Predictive churn scoring based on engagement signals (email opens, skip frequency, customer service contacts). Proactive outreach 30 days before predicted churn with personalized offers.

## Reactivation Campaign

Win-back series for churned subscribers with "we've missed you" messaging, comeback discounts, and new product highlights.
