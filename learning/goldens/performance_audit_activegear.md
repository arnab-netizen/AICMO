# ActiveGear Apparel – Performance Marketing Audit

## Brand Overview

**Brand:** ActiveGear Apparel  
**Industry:** Athletic & Outdoor Apparel (Ecommerce)  
**Audit Scope:** Comprehensive performance marketing evaluation across paid channels

## Executive Summary

ActiveGear spends $180K/month across Meta, Google, and TikTok with declining ROAS and inefficient channel allocation. This audit identifies performance gaps, budget optimization opportunities, and strategic recommendations to improve overall marketing efficiency by 35%.

## Current Performance Baseline

- **Total Ad Spend:** $180K/month
- **Blended ROAS:** 2.8x (declining from 3.5x six months ago)
- **Customer Acquisition Cost:** $48 (up from $35)
- **Revenue Per Channel:** Meta 55%, Google 30%, TikTok 15%

## Channel Deep-Dive: Meta Ads

**Spend:** $90K/month | **ROAS:** 3.2x  
**Issues:** Campaign structure fragmentation (47 active campaigns), audience overlap 35%, creative fatigue (same assets 90+ days)  
**Recommendations:** Consolidate to 8 core campaigns, implement CBO, refresh creative monthly, exclude converters from prospecting

## Channel Deep-Dive: Google Ads

**Spend:** $60K/month | **ROAS:** 2.6x  
**Issues:** Shopping feed errors, low-intent keywords draining budget, search lost IS 40% (budget constrained)  
**Recommendations:** Fix feed quality score, eliminate bottom 20% of keywords, reallocate $15K from Display to high-performing Shopping campaigns

## Channel Deep-Dive: TikTok

**Spend:** $30K/month | **ROAS:** 1.9x  
**Issues:** Broad targeting, no spark ads, inconsistent creative testing  
**Recommendations:** Shift to spark ads with influencer content, narrow targeting to fitness enthusiasts 18-34, increase creative testing velocity

## Conversion Rate Optimization

Site conversion rate at 1.8% (industry benchmark: 2.5%). Issues: slow mobile load time, complicated checkout, weak product page trust signals.

## Attribution & Tracking

Multi-touch attribution not implemented. Over-crediting last-click. Recommend MMM modeling for true incrementality measurement.

## Budget Reallocation Plan

- Meta: $90K → $95K (proven performer)
- Google Shopping: $40K → $55K (high intent, constrained)
- Google Display: $20K → $5K (poor ROAS)
- TikTok: $30K → $25K (optimize first, scale later)

## Projected Impact

- Blended ROAS improvement: 2.8x → 3.8x
- CAC reduction: $48 → $35
- Monthly revenue increase: $180K additional revenue with same spend
- Payback period: 2 months to implement recommendations

## Implementation Roadmap

**Month 1:** Campaign consolidation, feed fixes, creative refresh  
**Month 2:** Budget reallocation, CRO testing, attribution setup  
**Month 3:** Scale winning tactics, performance review, optimization cycle
