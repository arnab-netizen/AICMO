# AICMO Strategy + Campaign Report – FitFusion Studio

## Brand & Objectives

**Brand:** FitFusion Studio  
**Industry:** Fitness & Wellness  
**Primary Goal:** Launch membership campaign to hit 200 active members in 90 days  
**Location:** Austin, TX  
**Target Audience:** Busy professionals aged 28-45 seeking convenient, results-driven workouts

## Executive Summary

FitFusion Studio combines mindfulness and intensity in a boutique fitness environment designed for Austin's busy professionals. This 90-day membership launch campaign will leverage local partnerships, trial class offers, and community-building events to achieve 200 active members through a blend of paid acquisition, referral incentives, and social proof marketing.

## Positioning

FitFusion Studio is the only boutique fitness studio in Austin offering hybrid yoga-HIIT classes designed for time-strapped professionals who want both mental clarity and physical results. Unlike traditional gyms with impersonal environments or yoga-only studios lacking intensity, FitFusion delivers balanced 50-minute sessions that fit into lunch breaks or early mornings.

## Situation Analysis

Austin's fitness market is saturated with 200+ gyms and studios, but hybrid yoga-HIIT offerings remain niche. Target demographic (professionals 28-45) values convenience, community, and measurable results. Current market research shows 65% of Austin professionals want fitness solutions under 60 minutes with mental health benefits. FitFusion's 50-minute format addresses this directly.

## Strategy

Build membership base through three-phase approach: (1) Awareness via local partnerships and paid social, (2) Trial conversion with first-class-free offers and community events, (3) Retention through member challenges and referral incentives. Create urgency with founder membership pricing ($99/mo vs $129 standard) for first 100 sign-ups.

## Strategic Pillars

1. **Hybrid Value Proposition** - Communicate unique yoga + HIIT fusion benefit
2. **Convenience Promise** - 50-minute classes, prime scheduling, easy booking
