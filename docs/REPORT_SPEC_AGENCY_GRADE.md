## 4. Placeholder Rules

The following phrases and patterns **must never appear** in any client-facing export:

### Strictly Prohibited Phrases
- "Hook idea for day" (any variant)
- "will be populated once data is available"
- "TBD"
- "To be determined"
- "Lorem ipsum"
- "Placeholder"
- "TODO"
- "FIXME"
- "[INSERT]" (any bracketed placeholder)
- "TK" (journalist shorthand for "to come")
- "Generic persona"
- "Example objective"

### Content Indicators (Use Advanced Validation)
- Any section with fewer words than specified minimum (suggests incomplete)
- Sections that are exact copies of sections above (indicates duplication without customization)
- Strategic pillars named "Pillar 1", "Pillar 2", etc. (not customized)
- Campaign named "Campaign 1", "New Campaign", etc.

### Depth Checks
- Personas with no pain points listed
- Action items with "TBD" or "TBA" for dates or owners
- KPIs with targets of "TBD" or "TBA"
- Channel strategies with no rationale (just channel name)

---

## 5. Validation & CI

### Automated Validation
All client-facing exports are validated by `aicmo/quality/validators.py::validate_report()` before being offered for download.

**Validation Flow:**
1. User clicks "Export to PDF" / "Export to PPTX" / "Export as ZIP"
2. Backend calls `validate_report(report)` on the generated AICMOOutputReport
3. If error-level issues found:
   - Export is **blocked**
   - User is shown a list of issues with affected section names
   - User must regenerate or manually edit the report (if UI supports it)
4. If only warnings:
   - Export proceeds with warning message to operator
5. If no issues:
   - Export is generated and offered for download

### CI Testing
Canonical test briefs in `backend/tests/test_report_validation.py` assert that:
- Realistic briefs for target packages produce valid, export-ready reports
- Placeholder injection is reliably detected
- Minimal depth requirements are enforced
- No false positives (good reports don't fail validation)

---

## 6. Exceptions & Special Cases

### Operator-Only Previews
Operators may preview incomplete/draft reports in Streamlit without validation. This allows them to iterate before attempting client export.

### Stub Mode / Test Briefs
Stub-generated reports for internal testing may include placeholders intentionally. Validation only blocks **client exports**, not internal operations.

### Manual Report Editing
If AICMO someday supports manual editing of reports in the UI, the operator may clear validation issues and retry export without regenerating.

---

## 7. Success Metrics

A report meets agency-grade standards when:
- ✅ All required sections are present and populated (not empty)
- ✅ No prohibited placeholder text appears anywhere
- ✅ Minimum depth met for all required sections
- ✅ Content is customized to the brand/brief (not generic templates)
- ✅ Strategic connections are clear (personas → positioning → tactics, etc.)
- ✅ Action plan is specific and dated
- ✅ Validation reports zero error-level issues
